# Versioning

etclabscore/core-geth uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). The API definition that would demand increments to the major version is basically nil;
it can be expected that a major version bump would be accompanied by an entirely new repository and name.

Tagged versions use the suffix `-stable` and untagged versions (ie everything else) uses the `-unstable` suffix.
